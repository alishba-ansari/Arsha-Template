This was my one of first ever responsive websites project. Using Bootstrap I made this website from scratch and it was a fun project. I had learned HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap fully here so this was my main project to move on to learn javascript. And its fully responsive because i used to struggle with it making responsive.
Thankyou so much for your precious time.
